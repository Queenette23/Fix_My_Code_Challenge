Copyright - Plagiarism
You are tasked to come up with solutions for the tasks below yourself to meet with the above learning objectives.
You will not be able to meet the objectives of this or any following project by copying and pasting someone else’s work.
You are not allowed to publish any content of this project.
Any form of plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.
Requirements
Python Scripts
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
All your files should end with a new line
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
All your files must be executable
The length of your files will be tested using wc
C Scripts
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
All your files should end with a new line
Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
You are not allowed to use global variables
No more than 5 functions per file
In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called lists.h
Don’t forget to push your header file
All your header files should be include guarded

## Introduction

In this repository, you will find detailed explanations and code examples for working with if/else statements, loops, and functions in Python. These are fundamental concepts in programming and are widely used in Python development.

## If/Else Statements

If/else statements allow you to execute different blocks of code based on certain conditions. They are used to make decisions in your program. In this section, you will learn how to write if/else statements and understand their syntax and usage.

## Loops

Loops are used to repeatedly execute a block of code until a certain condition is met. Python provides two types of loops: `for` loops and `while` loops. In this section, you will learn how to use loops effectively in your Python programs.

## Functions

Functions in Python are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. They help in organizing your code and making it more modular. In this section, you will learn how to define and use functions in Python, as well as understand the concept of function parameters and return values.

## Examples

The `examples` directory contains several code examples that demonstrate the usage of if/else statements, loops, and functions in Python. Feel free to explore these examples and modify them according to your needs.
